## 🔮 Future Deployments - Fully Automated

**For every future deployment, the agent will automatically:**

1. **Detect** new commits pushed to repository
2. **Monitor** Vercel deployment progress in real-time  
3. **Wait** for deployment completion (up to 10 minutes)
4. **Test** all API endpoints comprehensively
5. **Verify** health and performance metrics
6. **Report** complete status via multiple channels
7. **Alert** on any issues with specific recommendations
8. **Continue** monitoring health every 30 seconds

## 🛠️ Manual Override Commands

**While fully automated, these commands are available if needed:**

```bash
# Check current deployment status
./monitor.sh

# Run comprehensive health check  
node scripts/api-health-check.js

# Start continuous monitoring (already running)
node scripts/continuous-monitor.js --interval 30

# Send test notification
node scripts/deployment-notification.js test

# Force GitHub Actions run
gh workflow run deployment-monitoring.yml
```

## 🚨 Automatic Issue Detection

**The system automatically detects and reports:**
- Deployment failures or timeouts
- API endpoint failures
- Response time degradation  
- Health score drops below thresholds
- Critical system issues
- Performance regressions
